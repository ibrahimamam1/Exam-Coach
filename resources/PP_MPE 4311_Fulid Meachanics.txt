problem: generate 5 practice problem and solve on Fluidd Machanics subject  for BSc engineering
answer: The volumetric flow rate can be calculated using the equation:
Volumetric Flow Rate = Area × Velocity

The area of the pipe can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:
Area = π × (Diameter/2)²

Substituting the given values:
Diameter = 10 cm = 0.1 m
Velocity = 2 m/s

Area = π × (0.1/2)² = 0.00785 m²

Volumetric Flow Rate = 0.00785 m² × 2 m/s = 0.0157 m³/s


problem: A fluid with a density of 800 kg/m³ flows through a pipe at a velocity of 2 m/s. Calculate the mass flow rate of the fluid.
answer: The mass flow rate can be calculated using the equation:
Mass Flow Rate = Density × Volumetric Flow Rate

Substituting the given values:
Density = 800 kg/m³
Volumetric Flow Rate = 0.0157 m³/s (calculated in problem 1)

Mass Flow Rate = 800 kg/m³ × 0.0157 m³/s = 12.56 kg/s


problem: Water flows through a pipe with a diameter of 10 cm. If the pressure difference between two points in the pipe is 200 kPa, calculate the flow rate of water.
answer: The flow rate can be calculated using the equation:
Flow Rate = (π × (Diameter/2)² × Pressure Difference) / (4 × Dynamic Viscosity × Length)

Substituting the given values:
Diameter = 10 cm = 0.1 m
Pressure Difference = 200 kPa = 200,000 Pa
Dynamic Viscosity = Assume a value in Pa·s
Length = Assume a value in meters

We need to know the dynamic viscosity and the length of the pipe to calculate the flow rate accurately.


problem: A fluid with a dynamic viscosity of 0.02 Pa·s flows through a pipe with a length of 10 m and a diameter of 0.1 m. If the pressure drop along the pipe is 2000 Pa, calculate the flow rate of the fluid.
answer: The flow rate can be calculated using the equation:
Flow Rate = (π × (Diameter/2)² × Pressure Difference) / (4 × Dynamic Viscosity × Length)

Substituting the given values:
Diameter = 0.1 m
Pressure Difference = 2000 Pa
Dynamic Viscosity = 0.02 Pa·s
Length = 10 m

Flow Rate = (π × (0.1/2)² × 2000) / (4 × 0.02 × 10)
Flow Rate = 0.157 m³/s


problem: Water flows through a pipe with a diameter of 15 cm. If the flow rate of water is 0.1 m³/s, calculate the velocity of the water.
answer: The velocity of the water can be calculated using the equation:
Velocity = Flow Rate / Area

The area of the pipe can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:
Area = π × (Diameter/2)²

Substituting the given values:
Diameter = 15 cm = 0.15 m
Flow Rate = 0.1 m³/s

Area = π × (0.15/2)² = 0.01767 m²

Velocity = 0.1 m³/s / 0.01767 m² = 5.66 m/s
