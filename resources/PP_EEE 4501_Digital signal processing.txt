problem: Calculate the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the sequence x[n] = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
answer: To calculate the DFT of a sequence, we use the formula:

X[k] = ∑[n=0 to N-1] x[n] * e^(-j2πkn/N)

Given the sequence x[n] = {1, 2, 3, 4}, we have N = 4. Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

X[0] = 1 * e^(-j2π00/4) + 2 * e^(-j2π01/4) + 3 * e^(-j2π02/4) + 4 * e^(-j2π03/4) = 10
X[1] = 1 * e^(-j2π10/4) + 2 * e^(-j2π11/4) + 3 * e^(-j2π12/4) + 4 * e^(-j2π13/4) = -2 + 2j
X[2] = 1 * e^(-j2π20/4) + 2 * e^(-j2π21/4) + 3 * e^(-j2π22/4) + 4 * e^(-j2π23/4) = -2
X[3] = 1 * e^(-j2π30/4) + 2 * e^(-j2π31/4) + 3 * e^(-j2π32/4) + 4 * e^(-j2π33/4) = -2 - 2j

Hence, the DFT of the sequence x[n] = {1, 2, 3, 4} is X[k] = {10, -2 + 2j, -2, -2 - 2j}.

problem: Given the transfer function H(z) = (1 - z^-1)/(1 + 0.5z^-1), determine the magnitude and phase response.
answer: To determine the magnitude and phase response from a transfer function, we can rewrite it in terms of z^-1 and evaluate it for different frequencies.

H(z) = (1 - z^-1)/(1 + 0.5z^-1)
= (z - 1)/(z + 0.5)

The magnitude response can be calculated as:

|H(e^(jω))| = |H(z)|, where z = e^(jω)

|H(e^(jω))| = |(e^(jω) - 1)/(e^(jω) + 0.5)|

The phase response can be calculated as:

∠H(e^(jω)) = ∠H(z), where z = e^(jω)

∠H(e^(jω)) = ∠(e^(jω) - 1) - ∠(e^(jω) + 0.5)

Evaluate the magnitude and phase response for different frequencies (ω) to obtain the frequency response.

problem: Implement a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with the following coefficients: h[n] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}.
answer: To implement an FIR filter, we convolve the input sequence with the filter coefficients. Given the coefficients h[n] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}, the output sequence y[n] can be calculated as:

y[n] = x[n]*h[0] + x[n-1]*h[1] + x[n-2]*h[2] + x[n-3]*h[3] + x[n-4]*h[4]

where x[n] is the input sequence.
