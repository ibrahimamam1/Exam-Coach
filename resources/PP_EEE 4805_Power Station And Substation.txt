problem: A power station generates electricity at 13.8 kV. If the power needs to be transmitted to a substation located 5 km away, calculate the transmission line's voltage drop assuming a line impedance of 0.4 + j0.6 ohms/km and a load current of 200 A.
answer: The voltage drop can be calculated using the formula:

Voltage Drop = Line Impedance * Distance * Load Current

Voltage Drop = (0.4 + j0.6 ohms/km) * 5 km * 200 A

The real part of the voltage drop represents the active power loss, and the imaginary part represents the reactive power loss.


problem: A substation receives power at 132 kV and steps it down to 11 kV for distribution to the local area. If the substation has a power transformer with a turns ratio of 12:1, calculate the primary and secondary currents when the load current is 100 A.
answer: The turns ratio of the transformer represents the voltage ratio. We can use the turns ratio to calculate the primary and secondary currents using the formula:

Primary Current / Secondary Current = Secondary Voltage / Primary Voltage
12:1 = 11 kV / 132 kV

From this, we can find the primary and secondary currents when the load current is 100 A.

problem: A power station generates electricity at 20 MW and has an efficiency of 90%. If the transmission and distribution losses from the power station to the substation are 5%, calculate the power received at the substation.
answer: The power received at the substation can be calculated as the product of the power generated at the power station and the overall efficiency (taking into account transmission and distribution losses).

Power Received = Power Generated * Efficiency

Power Received = 20 MW * (1 - Transmission Loss) * (1 - Distribution Loss)


problem: A substation receives power at 11 kV and steps it down to 400 V for industrial use. If the substation has a three-phase transformer with a turns ratio of 20:1, calculate the line current on the low-voltage side when the load current is 100 A.
answer: The turns ratio of the transformer represents the voltage ratio. We can use the turns ratio to calculate the line current on the low-voltage side using the formula:

Line Current (Low-Voltage Side) = Load Current / Turns Ratio

Line Current = 100 A / 20:1


problem: A power station has a generation capacity of 50 MW and operates at a load factor of 0.8. Calculate the energy generated by the power station in one year.
answer: The energy generated by the power station can be calculated by multiplying the generation capacity by the number of hours in a year, taking into account the load factor.

Energy Generated = Generation Capacity * Load Factor * Hours in a Year

Energy Generated = 50 MW * 0.8 * 365 * 24 kWh

Note: The load factor represents the average power generated as a percentage of the maximum power capacity over a given period.
