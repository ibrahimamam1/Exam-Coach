problem: A gas undergoes an isothermal expansion process at a constant temperature of 300 K. If the initial volume is 2 m³ and the final volume is 4 m³, calculate the work done by the gas.
answer: For an isothermal process, the work done by a gas can be calculated using the equation:
Work = nRT ln(Vf / Vi)

Where n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume.

Assuming the gas is an ideal gas, the number of moles can be calculated using the ideal gas equation:
n = PV / RT

Substituting the given values:
P = constant (since it's an isothermal process)
R = ideal gas constant
T = 300 K
Vf = 4 m³
Vi = 2 m³

First, calculate the number of moles:
n = PV / RT = constant

Then, calculate the work done:
Work = nRT ln(Vf / Vi)


problem: A piston-cylinder device contains 0.5 kg of air. The initial pressure is 200 kPa, and the initial volume is 0.1 m³. The air undergoes an adiabatic compression process with a final volume of 0.05 m³. If the heat capacity ratio (γ) for air is 1.4, calculate the final pressure.
answer: For an adiabatic process, the relationship between pressure and volume can be described by the equation:
Pf Vi^γ = Pi Vf^γ

Where Pf is the final pressure, Vi is the initial volume, Pi is the initial pressure, Vf is the final volume, and γ is the heat capacity ratio.

Substituting the given values:
Pf (0.1 m³)^1.4 = (200 kPa) (0.05 m³)^1.4

Solve for Pf to find the final pressure.


problem: A heat engine has an efficiency of 30%. If the engine absorbs heat energy of 5000 J, calculate the work output of the engine.
answer: The efficiency of a heat engine can be calculated using the equation:
Efficiency = (Work output) / (Heat input)

Rearranging the equation:
Work output = Efficiency × Heat input

Substituting the given values:
Efficiency = 30%
Heat input = 5000 J

Calculate the work output using the formula.


problem: A gas follows the ideal gas law with a constant pressure of 200 kPa and a volume of 2 m³. If the temperature increases from 300 K to 400 K, calculate the final volume.
answer: The ideal gas law states:
PV = nRT

Since the pressure is constant, the equation can be simplified to:
V / T = constant

Substituting the given values:
Initial volume, Vi = 2 m³
Initial temperature, Ti = 300 K
Final temperature, Tf = 400 K
Final volume, Vf = ?

Set up the equation using the principle that V / T = constant, and solve for Vf.


problem: A refrigeration cycle operates with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4. If the heat extracted from the refrigerated space is 5000 J, calculate the work input required by the cycle.
answer: The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigeration cycle is given by the equation:
COP = (Heat extracted) / (Work input)

Rearranging the equation:
Work input = (Heat extracted) / COP

Substituting the given values:
COP = 4
Heat extracted = 5000 J

Calculate the work input using the formula.
