question: A gas in a piston-cylinder system undergoes an isentropic compression process. The initial pressure is 1 MPa, the initial volume is 0.1 m³, and the final volume is 0.02 m³. If the heat capacity ratio (γ) for the gas is 1.4, calculate the final pressure.
answer: For an isentropic process, the relationship between pressure and volume can be described by the equation:
P1 / P2 = (V2 / V1)^(γ)

Where P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures, and V1 and V2 are the initial and final volumes.

Substituting the given values:
P1 = 1 MPa
V1 = 0.1 m³
V2 = 0.02 m³
γ = 1.4

Solve for P2 to find the final pressure.


question: A steam power plant operates on the Rankine cycle. The boiler pressure is 10 MPa, and the condenser pressure is 10 kPa. The turbine has an isentropic efficiency of 80%, and the pump has an isentropic efficiency of 90%. Calculate the thermal efficiency of the power plant.
answer: The thermal efficiency of a power plant operating on the Rankine cycle can be calculated using the equation:
Thermal Efficiency = (Wnet / Qin) × 100

Where Wnet is the net work output and Qin is the heat input.

To calculate the net work output, we need to consider the work done by the turbine and the work done by the pump. The heat input can be calculated by considering the enthalpy change between the boiler and the condenser.

Substitute the given values and calculate the thermal efficiency.
 

question: A refrigeration system operates on the reversed Carnot cycle. The refrigerant absorbs heat energy of 5000 J from the refrigerated space and rejects heat energy of 2000 J to the surroundings. Calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigeration system.
answer: The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigeration system operating on the reversed Carnot cycle can be calculated using the equation:
