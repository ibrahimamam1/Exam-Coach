problem: A centrifugal pump has an impeller diameter of 0.4 m and rotates at 1500 rpm. If the pump delivers a flow rate of 0.1 m³/s, calculate the pump's specific speed.
answer: The specific speed of a centrifugal pump can be calculated using the equation:
Specific Speed = (N √Q) / (H^0.75)

Where N is the pump's rotational speed in rpm, Q is the pump's flow rate in m³/s, and H is the pump's head in meters.

Substituting the given values:
N = 1500 rpm
Q = 0.1 m³/s

To calculate the specific speed, we need to know the pump's head.



problem: A pelton wheel turbine has a nozzle diameter of 0.3 m and operates with a water flow rate of 0.05 m³/s. If the jet speed is 40 m/s, calculate the power output of the turbine.
answer: The power output of a pelton wheel turbine can be calculated using the equation:
Power Output = (ρQgH)η

Where ρ is the density of water, Q is the water flow rate in m³/s, g is the acceleration due to gravity, H is the net head in meters, and η is the turbine efficiency.

Substituting the given values:
Q = 0.05 m³/s
Jet Speed = 40 m/s

To calculate the power output, we need to know the density of water, the net head, and the turbine efficiency.

problem: A reciprocating pump has a piston diameter of 0.2 m and operates at a speed of 120 rpm. If the piston stroke length is 0.3 m, calculate the pump's discharge.
answer: The pump's discharge can be calculated using the equation:
Discharge = (π/4) × D² × N × L

Where D is the piston diameter, N is the pump's rotational speed in rpm, and L is the piston stroke length.

Substituting the given values:
D = 0.2 m
N = 120 rpm
L = 0.3 m

Calculate the pump's discharge using the formula.

problem: A Francis turbine operates with a water flow rate of 2 m³/s and a net head of 50 m. If the turbine efficiency is 90%, calculate the power output of the turbine.
answer: The power output of a Francis turbine can be calculated using the equation:
Power Output = ρQgHη

Where ρ is the density of water, Q is the water flow rate in m³/s, g is the acceleration due to gravity, H is the net head in meters, and η is the turbine efficiency.

Substituting the given values:
Q = 2 m³/s
H = 50 m
Efficiency = 90%

To calculate the power output, we need to know the density of water.


problem: A gear pump has a gear diameter of 0.15 m and rotates at 3000 rpm. If the pump delivers a flow rate of 0.02 m³/s, calculate the pump's volumetric efficiency.
answer: he volumetric efficiency of a gear pump can be calculated using the equation:
Volumetric Efficiency = (Qa / Qt) × 100

Where Qa is the actual flow rate delivered by the pump and Qt is the theoretical flow rate.

Substituting the given values:
Qa = 0.02 m³/s
Qt = ?

To calculate the volumetric efficiency, we need to know the theoretical flow rate of the pump.
