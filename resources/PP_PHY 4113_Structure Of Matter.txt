problem: Calculate the energy of a photon with a frequency of 5 × 10^14 Hz.
answer: The energy of a photon can be calculated using the equation:

Energy = Planck's Constant (h) × Frequency

Substituting the given values:

Energy = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s × 5 × 10^14 Hz



problem: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron with a velocity of 5 × 10^6 m/s.
answer: The de Broglie wavelength of a particle can be calculated using the equation:

Wavelength = Planck's Constant (h) / (Mass × Velocity)

Substituting the given values for the mass of an electron and the velocity:

Wavelength = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s) / ((9.109 × 10^-31 kg) × (5 × 10^6 m/s))



problem: Calculate the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom.
answer: The Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the equation:

Bohr Radius = (ε₀ × h²) / (π × (e² × mₑ))

Where ε₀ is the permittivity of free space, h is Planck's constant, e is the elementary charge, and mₑ is the mass of an electron.

Substituting the given values:

Bohr Radius = [(8.854 × 10^-12 F/m) × (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s)²] / [π × ((1.602 × 10^-19 C)² × (9.109 × 10^-31 kg))]



problem: Determine the number of valence electrons in an atom with the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³.
answer: The electron configuration represents the distribution of electrons in an atom's energy levels and subshells. The number of valence electrons can be determined by looking at the outermost energy level.

In this case, the outermost energy level is the third energy level (n = 3). The s and p subshells in the third energy level contain a total of 8 electrons (2s² + 2p⁶). Therefore, there are 8 valence electrons.



problem: Calculate the mass defect and binding energy of a nucleus with a mass of 120.9 atomic mass units (u), while its individual protons and neutrons have a combined mass of 121.7 u.
answer: The mass defect is the difference between the actual mass of a nucleus and the sum of its individual protons and neutrons.

Mass Defect = (Sum of Proton and Neutron Masses) - (Actual Mass of Nucleus)

Mass Defect = 121.7 u - 120.9 u

The binding energy can be calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation:

Binding Energy = Mass Defect × (Speed of Light)²

Substituting the calculated mass defect into the equation:

Binding Energy = (Mass Defect) × (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)²
