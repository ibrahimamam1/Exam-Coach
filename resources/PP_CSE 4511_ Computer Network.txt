problem:  Convert the IP address "192.168.1.10" to binary.
answer: The IP address "192.168.1.10" can be converted to binary by converting each octet (segment) to its binary representation.

192 = 11000000
168 = 10101000
1 = 00000001
10 = 00001010

Therefore, the binary representation of the IP address "192.168.1.10" is: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010





problem:  Determine the subnet mask and network address given the IP address and subnet prefix length.
IP address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet prefix length: 24
answer: To determine the subnet mask, we need to convert the subnet prefix length to its binary representation and create a mask with that number of 1s followed by 0s.

Subnet prefix length: 24
Binary representation: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

Converting the binary representation to decimal gives us the subnet mask:

255.255.255.0

To find the network address, we perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask:

IP address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (255.255.255.0)
Network address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000

Therefore, the network address for the IP address "192.168.1.10" with a subnet prefix length of 24 is "192.168.1.0".




problem: Calculate the maximum number of hosts allowed in a subnet given the subnet mask.
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
answer: To calculate the maximum number of hosts allowed in a subnet, we need to determine the number of host bits (bits set to 0) in the subnet mask.

Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 (255.255.255.0)

In the subnet mask, there are 8 host bits set to 0. To calculate the maximum number of hosts, we subtract 2 from 2 raised to the power of the number of host bits.

Number of host bits: 8
Maximum number of hosts: 2^8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254

Therefore, the maximum number of hosts allowed in a subnet with the subnet mask "255.255.255.0" is 254.






problem: : Calculate the broadcast address given the network address and subnet mask.
Network address: 192.168.1.0
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.192
answer: To calculate the broadcast address, we perform a bitwise OR operation between the network address and the bitwise complement of the subnet mask.

Network address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 (192.168.1.0)
Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (255.255.255.192)

Bitwise complement of subnet mask: 00000000.00000000.00000000.00111111 (0.0.0.63)

Performing a bitwise OR operation:
Network address: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 (192.168.1.0)
Bitwise complement of subnet mask: 00000000.00000000.00000000.00111111 (0.0.0.63)
Result (Broadcast address): 11000000.10101000.00000001.00111111 (192.168.1.63)

Therefore, the broadcast address for the network address "192.168.1.0" with the subnet mask "255.255.255.192" is "192.168.1.63".






problem: Determine the class and default subnet mask of an IP address.
IP address: 10.22.50.5 
answer: To determine the class and default subnet mask of an IP address, we need to examine the range of the first octet.

First octet: 10 (Binary: 00001010)

Based on the range of the first octet, we can determine the class and default subnet mask as follows:

Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0
Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0 with a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
Class D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Reserved for multicast)
Class E: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (Reserved for experimental use)
In this case, the IP address "10.22.50.5" falls within the range of Class A addresses. Therefore, the class is A, and the default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0.
