problem: Determine whether the language L = {w | w contains an equal number of 0s and 1s} is regular or not.
answer: The language L = {w | w contains an equal number of 0s and 1s} is not regular. We can prove this using the pumping lemma for regular languages. Suppose L is regular. Let n be the pumping length given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string w = 0^n1^n. According to the pumping lemma, w can be divided into three parts: xyz, such that |xy| ≤ n, |y| > 0, and for any k ≥ 0, the string xy^kz must belong to L. However, if we pump y, the number of 0s and 1s will no longer be equal, violating the language's requirement. Hence, L is not regular.


problem: Convert the given regular expression (0+1)*(00+11) to an equivalent NFA.
answer: To convert the regular expression (0+1)*(00+11) to an equivalent NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton), we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create initial and final states.

Create an initial state q0.
Create a final state qf.
Step 2: Transition for (0+1)*

Add an epsilon transition from q0 to q1.
Add a self-loop transition for 0 and 1 at q1.
Step 3: Transition for 00+11

Add a transition from q1 to q2 for 00.
Add a transition from q1 to q3 for 11.
Step 4: Transition to the final state

Add an epsilon transition from q2 and q3 to qf.
Step 5: Set the initial and final states

Set q0 as the initial state.
Set qf as the final state.
The resulting NFA will have the following structure:

lua
Copy code
      0,1       0,1      0,1
q0 --------> q1 --------> qf
     ε         00,11     ε
      |                   ^

problem:  Convert the given context-free grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
Grammar:
S -> ASA | aB
A -> B | S
B -> b | ε
answer: To convert the given context-free grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Eliminate ε-productions.

Remove the production B -> ε.
Step 2: Eliminate unit productions.

Remove the production A -> B.
Replace all occurrences of A with B in other productions.
Step 3: Introduce new non-terminal symbols for terminals.

Introduce a new non-terminal C for the terminal 'a'.
Replace all occurrences of 'a' in the grammar with C.
Step 4: Convert productions to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side.

Replace the production S -> ASA with S -> AD.
Introduce a new non-terminal D.
Step 5: Convert long productions into multiple productions.

Replace the production S -> AD with S -> AE and E -> DA.
The resulting grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is:
S -> AE | aB | ASA
A -> a | b | ASA | AD
B -> b
E -> DA
C -> a


problem: Determine the language generated by the regular expression (a+b)abb(a+b).
answer: The language generated by the regular expression (a+b)abb(a+b) consists of all strings that have 'abb' as a substring. It can be described as the set of all strings where 'abb' appears at least once. Formally, the language can be represented as L = {w | w contains 'abb' as a substring}.

For example, the strings 'abb', 'aabbaabb', and 'baabbbba' belong to the language, while the strings 'aaa', 'bbb', and 'abbab' do not belong to the language.


problem: Determine whether the language L = {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} is a context-free language or not.
answer: The language L = {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} is not a context-free language. We can prove this using the pumping lemma for context-free languages. Suppose L is a context-free language. Let n be the pumping length given by the pumping lemma. Consider the string w = a^n b^n c^n. According to the pumping lemma, w can be divided into five parts: uvxyz, such that |vxy| ≤ n, |vy| > 0, and for any k ≥ 0, the string u(v^k)x(y^k)z must belong to L. However, if we pump the substring vxy, the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's will no longer be equal, violating the language's requirement. Hence, L is not a context-free language.
