problem: Calculate the total resistance of a series circuit consisting of three resistors with values of 10 Ω, 20 Ω, and 30 Ω connected in series.
answer: In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances. Therefore, the total resistance (R_total) can be calculated as follows:

R_total = R1 + R2 + R3
= 10 Ω + 20 Ω + 30 Ω
= 60 Ω

Hence, the total resistance of the series circuit is 60 Ω.

problem: Calculate the total capacitance of a parallel circuit consisting of three capacitors with values of 2 μF, 4 μF, and 6 μF connected in parallel.
answer: In a parallel circuit, the total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances. Therefore, the total capacitance (C_total) can be calculated as follows:

1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3
= 1/2 μF + 1/4 μF + 1/6 μF
= (3/6) + (6/6) + (4/6)
= 13/6 μF

C_total = 6/13 μF

Hence, the total capacitance of the parallel circuit is 6/13 μF.


problem: Calculate the power dissipated in a resistor of 10 Ω with a current of 2 A flowing through it.
answer: The power dissipated in a resistor can be calculated using the formula:

P = I^2 * R

where P is the power, I is the current, and R is the resistance.

Given that the resistance (R) is 10 Ω and the current (I) is 2 A, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = (2 A)^2 * 10 Ω
= 4 A^2 * 10 Ω
= 40 W

Hence, the power dissipated in the 10 Ω resistor is 40 W.


problem: Calculate the power factor of a circuit with a real power of 800 W and an apparent power of 1000 VA.
answer: The power factor (PF) of a circuit can be calculated using the formula:

PF = Real Power / Apparent Power

Given that the real power is 800 W and the apparent power is 1000 VA, we can substitute these values into the formula:

PF = 800 W / 1000 VA
= 0.8

Hence, the power factor of the circuit is 0.8.


problem: Calculate the total current flowing through a parallel circuit consisting of three resistors with values of 2 Ω, 4 Ω, and 6 Ω connected in parallel, when a voltage of 12 V is applied across the circuit.
answer: In a parallel circuit, the total current is the sum of the individual branch currents. To calculate the branch currents, we can use Ohm's Law:

I = V / R

where I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance.

For each resistor, we can calculate the branch currents as follows:

I1 = 12 V / 2 Ω = 6 A
I2 = 12 V / 4 Ω = 3 A
I3 = 12 V / 6 Ω = 2 A

The total current (I_total) can be calculated as the sum of the branch currents:

I_total = I1 + I2 + I3
= 6 A + 3 A + 2 A
= 11 A

Hence, the total current flowing through the parallel circuit is 11 A.
